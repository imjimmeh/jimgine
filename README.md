Just me messing around with MonoGame currently.

Currently solution is split into three projects:

1) Jimgine.Core - The core project. Contains all the various services that run to, well, run the "game"
2) Jimgine.Core.Models - Core models used by the engine
3) Jimgine.Test - Just a test to test the engine.
